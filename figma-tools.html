You can expand or collapse groups of layers to keep your workspace tidy.</p></li><li><p><strong>Renaming Layers:</strong> Double-click on a layer's name to rename it. This is particularly useful for maintaining a clear and organized structure, especially in complex designs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reordering Layers:</strong> Click and drag layers to change their stacking order. Layers at the top of the list are in the front, while those at the bottom are in the back.</p></li><li><p><strong>Grouping Layers:</strong> To organize your design, you can group related layers together. Select the layers you want to group, right-click, and choose "Group Selection." You can then collapse or expand the group in the Layers panel.</p></li><li><p><strong>Locking Layers:</strong> Locking layers prevents you from accidentally selecting or modifying them. Click the lock icon next to a layer to lock or unlock it.</p></li></ul><h2>Properties Panel</h2><p>The Properties panel is where you'll find styling options for selected objects. It allows you to fine-tune the appearance of your design elements to ensure they look exactly as you intend. Here's an overview of the Properties panel:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Fill and Stroke:</strong> You can adjust the fill color (interior) and stroke color (outline) of objects. Click on the respective color swatches to change colors. You can also modify the stroke width and style.</p></li><li><p><strong>Opacity:</strong> Use the opacity slider to make objects partially transparent. This is useful for creating various visual effects and overlays.</p></li><li><p><strong>Blending Modes:</strong> Figma offers a range of blending modes that determine how objects interact with each other. Experiment with different blending modes to achieve unique visual effects.</p></li><li><p><strong>Effects:</strong> Apply effects like shadows, blurs, and inner glows to objects. These effects add depth and dimension to your designs. Click the "+" button in the Effects section to add an effect, then adjust its settings.</p></li><li><p><strong>Corner Radius:</strong> For shapes like rectangles, you can adjust the corner radius to create rounded corners.
